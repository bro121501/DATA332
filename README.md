There were too many zipcodes/cities to graph so I used ChatGPT to help me divide it up into North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, and Northwest. I have redacted my Google API key.
If you need access to the key either create one for Google Maps, or email me at blakeoliver20@augustana.edu
